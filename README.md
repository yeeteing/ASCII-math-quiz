# ASCII Math Quiz


[ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_html_ascii.asp) is the numerical representation of the english characters, numbers and special characters.

This is a very basic website for me to practice ReactJS. 

It generates interactive math questions with ASCII code. 

First, the user has to figure out what number the ASCII codes are. Then, solve the mathematical question with the solved ASCII codes.
